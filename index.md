Sample Project 1

### Project 1: Code setup population

The code that I created in order to show what values are very small, small, medium, large, and very large. I used the elif function, which allowed me to give a range of values that described the different sizes. I named the data that I used as Nebraska_data, which allowed me to organize the data and make it clean and easy to use. I then printed the Nebraska data, which had all the population sizes, and ran my code. This gave me values and showed the sizes of them at the bottom.

Sample Project 2

This image shows the FEMA vs Custom Risk Store that we created in this sample project. The image shows that our custom risk score and fema risk score correlate and respond well together. The custom risk score increases, and so does the fema risk score, so this means that the plot is accurate and consistent. In this sample project, we learned how to create a scatter plot with the cleaned dataset that we have. It also taught us how to name the title of the scatter plot and both axes of the plot using code from the Python library. We used imports such as numpy, pandas, matplotlib.pyplot, and seaborn to create these scatter plots. These libraries are essential to creating scatter plots and organizing your data to make your code run cleanly.
