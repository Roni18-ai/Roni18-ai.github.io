The code that I created in order to show what values are very small, small, medium, large, and very large. I used the elif function, which allowed me to give a range of values that described the different sizes. I named the data that I used as Nebraska_data, which allowed me to organize the data and make it clean and easy to use. I then printed the Nebraska data, which had all the population sizes, and ran my code. This gave me values and showed the sizes of them at the bottom.
